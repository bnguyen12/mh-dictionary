# Monster Hunter Dictionary
A web application to get details on all the monsters in the Monster Hunter series!

Credit goes to CrimsonNynja for providing monster information. You can find that information here: https://github.com/CrimsonNynja/monster-hunter-DB

Sidenote: someone should really build out an API so I don't have to commit the icon files from that repo ðŸ¤·
